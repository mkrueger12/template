## Codebase Familiarization
Before helping with the request launch the following subagents in parallel to better understand the codebase.

1. Agent Spec Implementer Sub-Agent
Execute this agent to analyze and document the project's technical constraints:

**Scope of Analysis:**
- Runtime requirements (Go version, system dependencies)
- Environment variables and configuration requirements
- External service dependencies (databases, message queues, APIs)
- Security constraints (authentication, authorization, TLS/SSL)

2. Codebase Pattern Analyzer Agent (Run in Parallel)
Execute this agent to map the application's architectural patterns:

**Scope of Analysis:**
- Project structure and module organization
- Design patterns implemented (e.g., MVC, microservices, event-driven)
- Middleware and interceptor chains
- Error handling and recovery patterns
- Logging and observability patterns

- API contract definitions
- Testing patterns and coverage areas

## Request Help
After you have the context needed to solve this problem, generate a to-do list to address the issues provided. If you get stuck, stop and ask questions.Delegate as many tasks to general-purpose sub-agents as possible. You may use up to five sub-agents at a time.
