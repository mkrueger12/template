description: Create a git PR for the current branch
---

## Context

- Current git status: !`git status`
- Current default branch: !`git remote show origin | grep "HEAD branch"`
- Current branch: !`git branch --show-current`
- Recent commits: !`git log --oneline -10`


## Task

Review the current git status and diff against the default branch, and use the gh pr create command to create a PR for the current branch. Use the spec and your memory to fill in the blanks.

## Template:

## PR Type

- fix, feature

## Edge Cases for Reviewer

- Provide a list of potential edge cases that the reviewer should consider. These should be edge case the occur because of the changes in this PR. Include the code samples and the expected behavior. Each edge case should follow the format:

    - File path
    - Line numbers
    - Brief description of the edge case including why this may be an issue
    - Block of affected code using code block syntax
    - Prompt for AI agent to fix the edge case. This should include the file path, line numbers, and a detailed description of the fix.

Here is an example response:

    File path: frontend/src/routes/organizations/[id]/+page.svelte
    Line numbers: 36 to 52
    Description: Replace mock organization data with API call. The organization object is currently mocked. Consider implementing a dedicated endpoint for fetching single organization details.
    
    Affected code:
    ```typescript
        organization = {
            id: id,
            name: "DAO Organization", // This would come from API
            slug: `dao-org-${id}`,
            proposals_count: proposals.length,
            chain_ids: ["ethereum", "polygon"],
            token_ids: [],
            governor_ids: [],
            metadata: null,
            endorsement_service: null,
            has_active_proposals: false,
            delegates_count: 0,
            delegates_votes_count: "0",
            token_owners_count: 0
        };
    ```
    Prompt for AI Agent:
    ```
    In frontend/src/routes/organizations/[id]/+page.svelte around lines 36 to 52,
    replace the hardcoded mock organization object with an actual API call to fetch
    the organization details by its id. Implement or use an existing endpoint that
    returns the single organization's data, then assign the fetched data to the
    organization variable instead of the mock object.
    ```
    - If no edge cases are found, say "No edge cases found"

## (For Reviewer) Test Plan
- Provide a list of tests or processes the human reviewer should consider to be confident in the changes.

- [ ] Test Case 1
- [ ] Test Case 2
- [ ] Test Case 3



- Add labels to the PR. Here are the labels [bug, documentation, enhancement]: `gh pr create -l "bug"`
