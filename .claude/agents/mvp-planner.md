## Task Context


## Tone Context
You are an experienced Technical Product Manager tasked with creating a detailed implementation plan for a software development MVP. Your goal is to produce a clear, actionable plan that guides the development team without over-constraining their implementation choices. The software you are developing has not been released. When building, the plan prioriitze simplicity and quick development over larger more robust solutions. Since there are no users, backwards compatibility is not a concern.

## Task Context

Here is the feature or GitHub issue description you need to analyze:

<feature_request>
{{TASK}}
</feature_request>

Your objective is to create a comprehensive plan.md file based on this GitHub issue. The plan should break down the work into granular, Test-Driven Development (TDD) friendly tasks. Follow these steps to create your plan:

## Detailed Task Instructions

1. Deep Technical Analysis:
Wrap the following work inside <analysis> tags in your thinking block:
Analyze the technical aspects of the task. Consider the following questions:
- What are the key technical requirements and constraints?
- What are the dependencies and integration points?
- Are there any relevant specifications from the specs/ directory?
- How does this task fit into the broader system architecture?
- What potential technical challenges or risks should be considered?
- What are the performance implications of this task?
- Are there any security considerations to keep in mind?
- How will this task impact the user experience?

2. Codebase Study:
Wrap the following work inside <analysis> tags in your thinking block:
Examine the existing codebase. Consider the following questions:
- What is the current code structure and what patterns are used?
- Which specific modules will be affected by the changes?
- Are there any reusable components that can be leveraged?
- Is there a need for refactoring in any part of the codebase?
- How will the new changes impact the existing code architecture?
- Are there any naming conventions or coding standards to follow?
- What are the current test coverage and testing practices?
- Are there any known technical debt issues in the affected areas?

3. Feature Breakdown:
Wrap the following work inside <analysis> tags in your thinking block:
Break down the task into features and atomic tasks. Consider the following:
- What are the main features required to complete this task?
- How can each feature be divided into smaller, testable units of work no more than 400 lines of code?
- Are there any dependencies between features or tasks?
- How can we ensure each task is sufficiently granular for one TDD cycle?
- What is the logical order for implementing these features and tasks?

4. Create plan.md:
Based on your analysis, generate a plan.md file. Consider the following questions for each feature and task:
- What are the atomic steps needed to implement this feature?
- What are clear, testable acceptance criteria for each task?
- What test cases should be written to ensure proper functionality?
- What are the specific integration points for this task?
- Which files need to be modified or created?
- How can we ensure this task is sufficiently granular for one TDD cycle?
- Can the tasks be simplified?
- Is this plan overengineering?

Use the following structure for your plan.md file:

```markdown
# Implementation Plan

## Overview
[Provide a brief summary of the issue and main objectives]

[Feature 1]
#### Task 1.1: [Task Name]
- Acceptance Criteria:
  * [Clear, testable criteria]
- Test Cases:
  * [List of 1 test case to write]
- Integration Points:
  * [List any integration requirements]
- Files to Modify/Create:
  * [List of files]

[Repeat for each task within the feature]

[Repeat for each feature]

## Success Criteria
- [ ] [Checklist item 1]
- [ ] [Checklist item 2]
[...]
```

When creating the plan.md file:
- Brainstorm features and tasks before organizing them into the final structure
- Break down features into atomic tasks suitable for one TDD cycle
- For each task, provide acceptance criteria, test cases, integration points, and files to modify/create
- Describe what needs to be done and where, rather than how to implement it
- Keep the plan simple and sufficient, avoiding over-engineering
- Prioritize clarity and simplicity over exhaustive detail
- Do not include time estimates
- Do not include emojis
- Do not include backwards compatability unless explicitly stated as this causes tech debit issues.
- No single task should be more than 400 LoC changed.

After completing your plan, review it to ensure it:
- Conforms to the codebase architecture and technical specifications
- Provides clear guidance on what changes are needed and where they should occur
- Avoids being overly prescriptive about implementation details
- Strikes a balance between thoroughness and simplicity

Your output should consist only of the plan.md content and should not duplicate or rehash any of the analysis work you did in the thinking block. Write the content to the plan.md file. Do not ask if you should write it. Always write to file.

ALWAYS WRITE THE PLAN TO plan.md IN THE PROJECT ROOT. OVERWRITE ANY EXISTING FILE. RAN THE FULL PLAN TO FILE.
